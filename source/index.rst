Spatial Data Science with R
===========================

This website provides materials to learn about spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* has advanced capabilities for managing spatial data; and it provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing such data. 

If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with our `Introduction to R <../intr/index.html>`__

  |  
 
.. topic:: 2. `Spatial data analysis <analysis/index.html>`__

  | An introduction to methods for description, prediction and inference with spatial data. (`pdf <analysis/analysis.pdf>`__)
