Spatial Data Science with R
===========================

**This is the "raster/sp" version of this resource. These packages are now obsolete and this version of the website is no longer maintained. Please use the** `terra version <https://rspatial.org/index.html>`__ **instead.**


This website provides materials to learn about spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* has advanced capabilities for managing spatial data; and it provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing such data. 


If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with our `Introduction to R <../intr/index.html>`__
